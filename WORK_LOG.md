| Nov 20 | 945-1015am |       I began implementing the run length encoding bitmap compression, but I know that my code for sure doesn't work. It is a very rough beginning. |
| Nov 20 |  9-930pm   |                                            I tried to debug code by thinking through the compression steps 1 by 1. Code still does not work though. |
| Nov 21 |  930-50pm  |               I walked through a test case and realized that I need to treat when the bit is part of a sequence or when it starts a new sequence.   |
| Nov 29 |  815-9pm   | Optimize size of compressed bitmap by adjusting the number of bytes used to store the length of sequences of 0s and 1s and found that 5 is optimal. |
